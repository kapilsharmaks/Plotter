# Plotter
Plotter can be use to plot any type of graph like 
1. Line plot 
2. Scatter plot
3. Bar plot 
4. Histogram
5. Box plot 
6. Surface plot
7. Bubble plot

Anytype of data can be used like we can generate random values for a table of 100 rows and 5 columns, create own table of 4 rows and 5 columns or upload a file like csv/json/txt as an input data. 

I have also uploaded two csv file to test this code on your system.
